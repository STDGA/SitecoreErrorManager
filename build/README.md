# How to Build the Solution

- Make sure you have added the latest .Net 4.0 DLLs in the lib folder (latest
  Sitecore 6.6 release)
- If you wish to deploy the module to a local playground for testing, you can use
  the VS _Publish_ feature.
  (Open the Solution, right-click on the Unic.ErrorManager.Website
  Project and select "Publish...", define the webroot of your playground as
  target location.)
