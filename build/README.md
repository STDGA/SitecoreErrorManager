# How to Build the Solution

- If you wish to deploy the module to a local playground for testing, you can use
  the VS _Publish_ feature. Open the Solution, right-click on the
  Unic.ErrorManager.Website Project and select "Publish...". We've set the
  default publish location to `c:/Temp/Unic.ErrorManager`. You may want to
  define the webroot of your playground as target location.
- Check [installation instructions] (https://github.com/unic/SitecoreErrorManager/wiki/Installation) for further steps required in your playground to fully test Sitecore Error Manager.
